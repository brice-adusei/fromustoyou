“From Us To You” — purpose & what the site is
From Us To You is a music-discovery / review project built around the idea that how you listen shapes what you’ll enjoy. Instead of pretending reviews are “objective,” the site makes the reviewer’s taste lens explicit, then uses that lens to help readers interpret recommendations.
What the site is meant to do:
Introduce the project: a collective of reviewers sharing music “from us to you,” with context about their listening biases.
Define listening styles: each reviewer (and optionally the reader) gets a compact “listening style code” that summarizes how they tend to connect with music.
Visualize albums/tracks on maps: reviews aren’t just text—music gets placed on simple 2-axis maps so people can scan vibe/fit quickly.
Help readers find reviewers like them: so “if you’re like X, you’ll probably agree with Y’s taste,” rather than chasing one-size-fits-all ratings.
The maps (what they’re for)
The maps are a fast, visual summary of how a release feels along two dimensions.
Example (the one you’ve been using):
Lyrics ↔ Sonics: is the hook in the writing/message, or in the texture/groove/production?
Challenging ↔ Accessible: does it reward patience / feel demanding, or does it click easily?
Why maps work here:
They give a 30-second read of a project before someone commits.
They’re comparable across reviewers (even when opinions differ).
They let you show “I loved this” and “it’s niche,” without forcing a numeric score.
Listening styles (what they’re for)
Listening styles are the “label on the reviewer.” They make your intros + reviews more interpretable.
Using your current framework:
Lyrics vs Sonics
Immediate vs Growing
Emotional vs Analytical
Personal vs Communal (or your newer idea like Old Head vs New Head)
Short purpose statement for listening styles:
They help readers understand why someone rated something the way they did.
They reduce “you’re wrong” arguments and replace them with “you’re listening differently.”
They let the site recommend reviewers, not just music.
