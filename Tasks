HTML tasks for your quiz page (make it look better)
1) Add proper document structure + layout wrappers
 Wrap everything inside:
<header> (brand + nav)
<main> (quiz UI)
<footer> (small text/links)
 Inside <main>, add a centered container:
<div class="container"> to control max width
 Use semantic sections:
<section class="hero"> for title/intro
<section class="quiz"> for the active question UI
<section class="result"> for the results UI (hidden until finished)
2) Build a “quiz card” layout (so it doesn’t look like raw text)
 Create a single card wrapper:
<article class="card">
 Inside that card, define consistent blocks:
<div class="progress"> (progress text + progress bar)
<h2 class="question"> (question text)
<p class="desc"> (optional description line)
<div class="answers"> (buttons)
3) Replace plain answer rows with real buttons + accessible structure
 Put answers in:
<div class="answers" role="group" aria-label="Answer choices">
 Use <button type="button"> for each answer (not links / not divs)
 Ensure each question updates a single <h2> and buttons update in-place (HTML side: keep IDs/classes stable)
4) Make the result feel like a “moment”
 Create a dedicated result card area:
<section class="result" hidden>
 Include:
“Your result” label
Large 4-letter code element (e.g., <div class="type-code">S I A P</div>)
2–4 sentence description block
A “Share” row (optional): copy-to-clipboard button, or just a styled link placeholder
“Restart” as a primary button
5) Add a top nav even if other pages aren’t ready yet
This alone makes it feel like a site rather than a demo.
 Add <nav> with links:
Home
Quiz (current)
Maps (placeholder page for now)
Reviewers (placeholder page for now)
About (placeholder page for now)
 Mark current page:
aria-current="page" on the Quiz link
6) Add a progress bar element (HTML only)
Right now you show “Question X of Y” as text. Keep it, but add:
 <progress> element (simple + accessible), or
 a <div class="progress-bar"><span style="width:…"></span></div> (if you prefer styling control)
(Your JS can update the value/width, but this is an HTML task: add the element + hooks.)
7) Add small microcopy that improves clarity
 Under the title, add a single sentence:
“Pick the option that feels most true — no wrong answers.”
 Under the answers, add:
“You can restart at any time.”
8) Add a footer that “finishes” the page
 Footer content:
short line about the project
link placeholders: “What are listening styles?” “How maps work”
copyright/name
Optional but high-impact HTML additions (still quiz-only)
A) Add a “style axes” preview block under the intro
 Add a mini section showing the 4 axes as badges/pills:
Lyrics ↔ Sonics
Immediate ↔ Growing
Emotional ↔ Analytical
Personal ↔ Communal
This sets context before they answer anything.
B) Add a “reviewers matching” stub under results
Even if it’s not wired yet:
 Add a <div class="matches"> area with 3 empty reviewer cards
Later JS can populate it, but HTML-wise it makes the results page feel complete.
File-based checklist (what you’ll likely edit)
Even without seeing your repo, most GitHub Pages setups are:
 index.html: add header/main/footer structure + quiz card markup
 styles.css (or similar): you’ll style it after, but add the classes/IDs now
 Any JS file: only add hooks if needed (IDs/classes), but your logic stays
